## About

This project was heavily inspired by [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) and the way [Zero To One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one) was written. Turning video or lecture content into written form can make it more accessible, and adding exercises can allow you to apply what you know.
